#Flip-it

###What does it do?  
I'm glad you asked! Flip-it takes a file of your choosing and parses out the integers. It then converts those integers to binary and flips all zeros to ones and all ones to zeros before converting it back to an integer. It adds the new and improved sentence back to your file so you can see how things have changed.  

###Ok... But why though?  
Because it's cool...  

###You've convinced me! How do I run this?

3. Navigate into your fancy new flip-the-bit folder  
4. Type: python3 flipit.py [/path/to/file.txt]  
5. Express shock and awe at the results
